 by default the scheduling policy is set to Other
available scheduling policies are 
1) SCHED_FIFO
2) SCHED_RR
3) SCHED_OTHER
default priority is 0

max priority for Other is 0
max priority for FIFO and RR is 99

4) to use CPU_SET or CPU_CLEAR, we need to define below macro as the first line of code in the file otherwise it will not compile
#define _GNU_SOURCE

5) To change the policy and priority use below api
1) pthread_attr_init();//initialize with default values
2) pthread_attr_getschedparam();//
3) change the priority in sched_param struct
4) pthread_attr_setschedparam();
5) pthread_attr_setinheritsched(attr, PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED)//withou this flag the thread will use the policy of creating thread which is by default set to SCHED_OTHER
6) pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(attr, POLICY);
7) pthread_create()
